# Multi-Agent Explorations

Multi-agent systems are extremely powerful concepts and together with progress in building more performant LLM models and advances in prompting methodology, etc., many believe that multi-agent pipelines can be built to mimic many typical human workflows.

In this repo, I will document my explorations to build multi-agent systems.

## Compare LangGraph/LangChain-based RAG pipeline with CrewAI/LlamaIndex-based pipeline
My first exploration shows a comparison of a RAG pipeline using a lower-level wrapper like LangGraph/LangChain with one that uses a higher-level wrapper like CrewAI (plus tooling from LlamaIndex).  See [here](multiAgentExplorations/crewAI_LlamaIndex_Trials) for more details on this exploration!
